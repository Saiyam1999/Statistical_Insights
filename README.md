The Repository contains several Statistical and Methodological approaches to Data Science.
Beginning from topics like Linear Regression it traverses its way to topic like Q-Q plots and other statistical approaches.
Each folder contains:
1. The result for the approach used in the README file
2. The code used for the approach.
3. A link to my personal blog which throws light on the concept.
